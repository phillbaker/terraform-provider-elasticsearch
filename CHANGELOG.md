## [1.4.3] - 2020-09-10
### Changed
- Fixed issue where diffs may not be detected for the resources `elasticsearch_kibana_object`, `elasticsearch_opendistro_destination`, `elasticsearch_opendistro_ism_policy_mapping`, `elasticsearch_opendistro_monitor`, `elasticsearch_xpack_role`, `elasticsearch_xpack_role_mapping`, and data source `elasticsearch_opendistro_destination` (#65).


## [1.4.2] - 2020-09-03

- Fixed import for resources: `elasticsearch_opendistro_ism_policy`, `elasticsearch_opendistro_role`, `elasticsearch_opendistro_roles_mapping`.
- Fixed diffs for sets in `elasticsearch_opendistro_role`.
- Allow omitting tenant permissions
- Fix `elasticsearch_xpack_watch` resource not detecting diffs outside of terraform (#65). The watch API may return default values that were not passed in the original request, e.g. for log actions, `"level": "info"`, which will result in a perpetual diff unless it's pulled into the definition.
