  mappings = <<EOF
{
  "people": {
    "_all": {
      "enabled": false
    },
    "properties": {
      "email": {

## Schema

### Required

- **name** (String) Name of the index to create

### Optional

- **aliases** (String) A JSON string describing a set of aliases. The index aliases API allows aliasing an index with a name, with all APIs automatically converting the alias name to the actual index name. An alias can also be mapped to more than one index, and when specifying it, the alias will automatically expand to the aliased indices.
- **auto_expand_replicas** (String) Set the number of replicas to the node count in the cluster
- **codec** (String) The `default` value compresses stored data with LZ4 compression, but this can be set to `best_compression` which uses DEFLATE for a higher compression ratio. This can be set only on creation.
- **force_destroy** (Boolean) A boolean that indicates that the index should be deleted even if it contains documents.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **load_fixed_bitset_filters_eagerly** (Boolean) Indicates whether cached filters are pre-loaded for nested queries. This can be set only on creation.
- **mappings** (String) A JSON string defining how documents in the index, and the fields they contain, are stored and indexed. To avoid the complexities of field mapping updates, updates of this field are not allowed via this provider. See the upstream [Elasticsearch docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/indices-put-mapping.html#updating-field-mappings) for more details.
- **number_of_replicas** (String) Number of shard replicas
- **number_of_shards** (String) Number of shards for the index. This can be set only on creation.
- **refresh_interval** (String) How often to perform a refresh operation, which makes recent changes to the index visible to search. Can be set to `-1` to disable refresh.
- **routing_partition_size** (Number) The number of shards a custom routing value can go to. This can be set only on creation.
